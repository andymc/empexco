                <p>Brooklyn Zelenka is a polyglot programmer, a founding partner at
                    Robot Overlord Software, and coffee enthusiast. She has been doing
                    production Phoenix work for a few years, mentored teams through
                    their adoption of Elixir, and released several BEAM libraries
                    including Quark, Witchcraft, and Exceptional. She is the founder
                    and organizer of multiple Vancouver meetups and conferences,
                    variously centred around functional programming, culture,
                    and mentorship. Lately she has been thinking a lot about the
                    success and failure modes of different tech disciplines,
                    scaling blockchain VMs, and how dependent types can help save us
                    from ourselves. When not roaming the world as a digital nomad,
                    Brooklyn is based out of Vancouver, Canada.</p>
