        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
            SMS is the dominant communication channel for how business is done in Africa. The healthcare industry, in particular, has taken advantage of targeted messaging to better patient outcomes. Our team had the opportunity to architect a messaging platform that integrates into any number of partner hospitals to leverage SMS. By filtering patients based on their condition, demographics, or location, healthcare workers can effectively communicate with their patient base. To achieve this, medical records need to be up-to-date. How do we effectively manage updates in a way that is fault-tolerant? How can we ensure that we don't overwhelm a partner's API? What solution gives us the tools to support multiple partners in the same system? In this talk, we'll share how we used GenStage to answer all of these questions and share our road to production.
