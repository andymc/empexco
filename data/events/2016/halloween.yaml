  EMPEX, the Empire City Elixir Conference, is a sophisticated conference series for the Elixir programming language and ecosystem held in New York City. We bring a sense of aesthetic and fun to the growing Elixir community.

  The Halloween Lightning Talks are an evening costume party featuring fun and several short technical talks. Costumes strongly encouraged.

presentations_intro: |
    We're excited to announce the following presentations for our first Lightning Talks!
presentations:
  - title: "A Link to the Past: Messages from the Dead"
    id: antaramian-a-link-to-the-past
    presenters:
      - antaramian-david
    description: |
      In this talk, we will overview the principles of process messaging and how process monitors
      allow us to respond to failures elsewhere. In particular, we will be looking at the message
      a process broadcasts to monitors when it fails and how this can be used strategically for
      failure patterning instead of linking the processes together.

  - title: "Railway Programing With With"
    id: bell-railway-programming-with-with
    presenters:
      - bell-chris
    description:
      Using `with` to simplify complex control flow and implement railway oriented programming with Elixir.

  - title: "Elixir Through other Eyes: A Non-Rubyist's Take"
    id: difrancesco-elixir-through-other-eyes
    presenters:
      - difrancesco-ben
    description: |
      The Elixir community has grown in leaps and bounds over the past couple of years. It's fair to
      say that much of this growth has come from Ruby developers eager to find something new. But
      as Elixir's popularity continues to rise, it has begun to attract attention from other language
      communities. To continue to grow and thrive, the budding Elixir community needs to welcome
      developers from other backgrounds and understand their perspectives.

      What would a developer who learned Ruby and didn't really care for it (gasp!) think about Elixir?
      One who spends most days in an IDE, doesn't really mind the square bracket hellscape of Objective-C's
      syntax, and loves the strict, static type system of Swift?

      In this short talk, you'll hear from one such developer. Beyond his experience learning Elixir, you'll
      hear his perspectives on what the community does well and how it might improve in attracting and
      welcoming developers from other programming communities.

  - title: "Realtime Music Collaboration"
    id: hoglund-realtime-music-collaboration
    presenters:
      - hoglund-andrew
    description: |
      Overview of building a web application that allows for realtime collaborative music
      making using Phoenix Channels and the Web Audio API.

  - title: "Using GraphQL for Your Elixir APIS"
    id: newell-using-graphql-for-your-elixir-apis
    presenters:
      - newell-david
    description: |
      GraphQL, the API query language from Facebook, offers a lot of advantages over a RESTful API,
      including a queryable schema and built in support for custom queries. Come learn how to use
      GraphQL in Pheonix and your own projects. We will go over how to discover the functionality of
      a GraphQL API, advantages and disadvantages to REST and discuss the full set of CRUD operations,
      including efficiently querying related models.

  - title: "Hey Little Twelve Toes: Extending Elixir to support base-12 numbering"
    id: price-hey-little-twelve-toes
    presenters:
      - price-cameron
    description: |
      Learn why the base-12 numbering system makes life easier.

  - title: "Characterizing Intelligence with Elixir"
    id: smith-characterizing-intelligence-with-elixir
    presenters:
      - smith-jeff
    description: |
      Artificial intelligence systems can be much harder to reason about than deterministic systems.
      During the development and operations of an AI, you must continually make inferences about it
      behavior under different circumstances, because sufficiently sophisticated AI systems are simply
      too complex for even their developers to fully characterize from source code alone. Ultimately,
      the behavior of an AI is an emergent property of its implementation and use.

      This talk will show how tools and technologies from the BEAM ecosystem can address this unique
      challenge in constructing AIs: how to understand what you've built. Examples will be shown in
      Elixir, using Dialyzer and Concuerror.
