  **About Bobby:** Bobby is a developer who yells at computers for Wombat Security Technologies. Beginning in C/PHP/Python, he has since walked into the world of Ruby and ended up seeing the light of Elixir and Erlang some years ago and has not looked back. In his downtime, he wears loud pants, travels with his awesome partner in crime, and yells at computers more.
