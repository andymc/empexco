bio: |
  Brooklyn Zelenka is a polyglot programmer, a founding partner at
  Robot Overlord Software, and coffee enthusiast. She has been doing
  production Phoenix work for a few years, mentored teams through
  their adoption of Elixir, and released several BEAM libraries
  including Quark, Witchcraft, and Exceptional. She is the founder
  and organizer of multiple Vancouver meetups and conferences,
  variously centred around functional programming, culture,
  and mentorship. Lately she has been thinking a lot about the
  success and failure modes of different tech disciplines,
  scaling blockchain VMs, and how dependent types can help save us
  from ourselves. When not roaming the world as a digital nomad,
  Brooklyn is based out of Vancouver, Canada.
