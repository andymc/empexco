bio: |
  Cameron has been developing software since the 90's using many different languages and platforms, but especially C, C++, Java, and Ruby.  In 2015 he discovered Elixir and the immutable paradigm.  Since then, he's been joyfully unlearning his imperative object-oriented instincts, and embracing the world of functional programming.  Cameron is currently the CTO of TRX.tv, and a director of Mint Digital and Boomf.com.
