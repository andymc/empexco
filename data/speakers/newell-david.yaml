bio: |
  David Newell first got into programming in the 4th grade. He had the opportunity to build a robot out of LEGOs and learned how to make the robot move through code. Since that experience, David has been continuously learning more about software and programming languages. Over the decades, he's has written some truly horrifying code, culminating an adding a macro system to JavaScript. This work has given a better appreciation of the work that goes into making an elegant language like Elixir.
